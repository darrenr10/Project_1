# Hedging Bits
Project 1 - Chelsea Senter, Darren Raymond, Emi Lopez, Meredith Johnson, and Ryan Lassiter<p><p>

Welcome to our first project!<p><p>


### Overview
In this project, we wanted to analyze Bitcoin's reaction to several events that occurred in 2020. Obviously, Covid-19 has been the #1 story of 2020, so we wanted to look at that as well as the summer protests due to social unrest following the death of George Floyd and the 2020 U.S. Election. <p><p>
